# Real-Time Answers

Real-Time Answers is a web application that allows users to upload images, transcribe text from them, and receive answers to questions based on the transcribed content. The application uses WebSocket for real-time communication and includes text-to-speech functionality.

## Features

- Image upload and text transcription
- Real-time question answering
- Text-to-speech output
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support
- WebSocket communication for real-time updates
- Background sync for offline functionality

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- TypeScript
- OpenAI API
- WebSocket (ws)
- Google Text-to-Speech (gtts)
- Service Workers for PWA functionality

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the TypeScript source files
- `dist/`: Contains the compiled JavaScript files
- `public/`: Contains static files served to the client

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
5. Start the server: `npm start`

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser
2. Upload an image containing text
3. The application will transcribe the text and generate an answer
4. The answer will be displayed on the screen and read aloud using text-to-speech

## Development

- Run the development server: `npm run dev`
- The server will restart automatically when changes are detected in the source files
